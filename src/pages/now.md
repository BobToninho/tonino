# Now

_Last updated on June 1st, 2024._

_See [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com) for why this page exists. Thanks for the idea!_

I recently moved to Vienna, Austria, coming from a small town in Italy. One of the primary reasons for moving is getting a job at Dynatrace, a very good software observability company. I am now a software there and I spent most of my time developing third party integrations for one of Dynatrace's new products: Workflows.

I am currently finishing my studies in Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity in Udine university. I am lucky that I can attend the courses entirely remote.

I am reading couple of books: 1984 by George Orwell, Diary of an Invasion by Andrey Kurkov and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. I find the latter the most challenging book I ever read.

I am planning to start contributing to the neovim project.

I keep a journal written in Latex. I like the idea of having a well-formatted and immutable pdf as output. I don't think I will share my journal publicly.
