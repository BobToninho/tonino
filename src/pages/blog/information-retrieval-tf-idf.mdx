## Boolean model

Uses boolean operators to perform queries. The terms therefore can either be present in the document or not, dividing `N` in 2 parts.

`sim(d_j, q) ϵ {0, 1}`

### Pros

- it is very simple and clear to understand

### Contra

- it is not much easy to understand for non-technical users, for instance because in boolean logic the AND operator corresponds to an "or" in natural language
- it does not perform any kind of ranking
- partial matches are not possible

## Vector space model

Draws the documents and the keywords in a `t` dimensional space. Each keyword represents a point in this hyperspace from which we can draw a vector that starts from the origin, which represents the document. The query is also one of the vectors. This allows to rank documents by similarity.

|          |        |
| -------- | ------ |
| keyword  | point  |
| document | vector |
| query    | vector |

This model makes possible to compare keywords and their relationship with documents by means of mathematical operations, such as the `cos`. Each vector is **independent**, it is not related to the other vectors.

<code>
	sim(d<sub>j</sub>, q) ϵ [0, 1]
</code>

Conversely from the Boolean model, now each keyword has a weight <code>w<sub>i,j</sub></code>, which is not trivial to compute. Introducing TF-IDF. TF-IDF means: **T**erm **F**requency - **I**nverse **D**ocument **F**requency.

## Term Frequency

![Term Frequency formula](/assets/images/term-frequency.v1.png)

The number of occurrencies of a term in a document compared to the maximum frequency of a term in that document. It is therefore a relationship between the selected term and the term that occures more times in a document. It is therefore in the interval (0, 1).

## Inverse Document Frequency

![Inverse Document Frequency formula](/assets/images/inverse-document-frequency.v1.png)

Document Frequency (log argument flipped upside down): relationship between the number of documents that contain the selected term and the total number of documents. The inverse of the document frequency now comes natural.

_log_ is uset to mitigate the importance of <abbr title="Inverse Document Frequency">IDF</abbr>, giving more importance to <abbr title="Term Frequency">TF</abbr>.

<abbr title="Term Frequency">TF</abbr> is different for every document. <abbr title="Inverse Document Frequency">
	IDF
</abbr> is always the same.

The multiplication of TF and IDF gives the weight <code>w<sub>i,j</sub></code>:
