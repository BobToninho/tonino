This is notoriously cumbersome in (Neo)vim.

For a quick experience you will need [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim).

First, you need to search the occurrencies you want to replace. Run `:Telescope live_grep` and type what you need. Remember to use `rg` syntax for optimal filtering.
When you are satisfied with the results, press `CTRL-Q` to add the results to the quickfix list (`:h Quickfix`).
Ultimately, type `:cdo s/gr/ep/gc` where `s/gr/ep/gc` is the typical, perl-based, search syntax inside vim. Use `gc` to give confirmation for every item, remove `c` if you feel very sure. I am not sure if `g` is actually needed but we'll leave it to make sure.
