<!-- WHY -->
I am writing this post because I want to understand what type of developer I am. For doing this, I want to categorize software developers in Craft oriented and in Product oriented. This is a writedown of the former.

<!-- WHAT -->
Craft oriented developers are people that are particularly caring about what they do. When you love what you do, you want to do it perfectly. If you want to do it perfectly, you put a lot of time in it. If you want to do it perfectly, you put a lot of care in it. Often they are meticulous people that want all the details to be perfect, to be how it _should_ be.
