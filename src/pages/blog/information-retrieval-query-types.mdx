There are 3 types of queries that an <abbr title="Information Retrieval System">IRS</abbr> can receive:

1. Keyword based
2. Pattern matching
3. Structural

## Keyword based

Can be divided in:

- **Single words** — return documents that contain at least one of the words
- **Contextual** — find words next to each other
- **Boolean** — uses boolean operators
  - Usually it is relaxed by means of fuzzy boolean logic
- **Natural language** — harder for the system, easier for the user.
  - Example: Conversational search of Siri, Alexa

## Pattern matching

Can be divided in:

- **Words**
- **Prefix** — big part of the meaning is in the radix of the words, not at the end
- **Suffix** — can lead to opposite results (example: "relevant", "irrelevant")
- **Substring**
- **Range** — very useful for dates and numbers. For text is not
- **RegExp** — useful only for technical users (computer scientists...)
- **Extended pattern** — simplified RegExps

In pattern matching it is good practice to allow errors, both in queries and in documents. [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) can be used.

## Structural

Based on the structure of the text. Since the web was invented they became more important. Can be divided in:

- **Fixed** — email (sender, recipient, subject)
- **Hierarchical** — book (chapter, section, subsection)
- **Hypertextual** — non linear, linked documents contained in a graph

## More query types

- Query By Example
- Spoken query
- Long queries
- Different UIs than search box only
