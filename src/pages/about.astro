		<p>
			I am a guy that enjoys spending time writing software. I like to write code and I like to find solutions to
			problems.
		</p>

		<p>
			Attention and method are two important aspects in software engineering. Attention because when you create
			software, you always have <em>many options</em>. Writing code can be simply reduced to choosing an alternative
			between many others, or finding a new alternative to add to the pool of the alternatives. Every decision in
			software needs to have a reason, there must be a strong opinion on why something was done. From writing a single
			line of code to designing a whole platform architecture. With time and experience, a subset of these strong
			opinions are automatic. This is because in software there are many patterns. You know that everytime you have to
			center a <code>div</code> in CSS, you use flex, grid or the good old <code>margin: 0 auto;</code>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Other than software engineering, I enjoy spending time with people. It's truly enriching when you are just
			together with your friends, people that you know you can trust and have fun with. I love to know the story of who
			I meet. I believe anyone can have something interesting and unique to show. This is the beauty of bein humans, of
			being concious creatures that can interact between each other in complex ways.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the photo below you can see me with my girlfriend and some of my best friends. It's incredible how I met them:
			if I didn't attend that German course while doing an Erasmus in Austria, I would have missed such moments and
			opportunities.

		<p>We spent together a part of my life that I will never forget. And we are going to spend more of it, for sure.</p>

		<p>Some things I do in non particularly meaningful order:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><p>I sign my git commits</p></li>
			<li><p>I use neovim</p></li>
			<li><p>I switched back to light theme in all my devices and apps</p></li>
		</ul>
